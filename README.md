SUBMISSION DETAILS
START DATE: Tuesday 1st October 2024
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: Friday 4th October 2024

NOTE: We will monitor the submission date from commit, We will only review the commit that is done till Submission date.
NOTE: You need to leave a seperate readme instruction outlining in detail how to run the application locally.

The point of this test is to understand your coding etiquette. For this task you are not expected to integrate any API's, but you will be given example data that you must turn into mock data that you must store on-site for use by specific fields.

You will be graded on how organized your codebase is, how you structure your common variables and components, your etiquette during version control and comitting work, and of course how well your product reflects on the requirements and any enhancements you choose to implement through your own initiative to deliver a better product than originally requested.

Your consideration of other users and developers who will maintain and collaborate with your code is also going to be noted, so good etiquette in terms of documenting work and comments within the codebase is recommended.

REQUIREMENTS:

A user wants to be able to log in to a website, where he can go to the issues section and fill in certain details in a form.

On the log in screen, there should be some validation to ensure the input is appropriate. The user can view the password they have typed if they press on the eye icon. If the user selects to keep themselves logged in, then whenever they close and and reopen the browser/tab, they must not have logged out and stayed logged in. Otherwise such behaviour should have logged the user out.

A user also wants to see a left navigation menu once he has logged in. The specifications of how the hover and select buttons work in the left navigation menu is included in the leftNavigation.png file. Selected sections are deep orange, hovering sections is transparent orange. The dark theme switch is non functional. The left navigation menu should only pop out when it is hovered over. Otherwise, it should compress again. The compressed version is shown in issuePage.Png

All pages in left navigation menu is empty except Issues and clicking their button opens empty pages.  The landing page however should not be issues page, but the dashboard page. On issues page, you have several different fields, including open text fields, dropdowns, and number fields.

The example data for dropdowns is: Priority (high, low, medium), DC Switch Status (On, Off), Status (Active, Inactive), Select Role (Admin, Standard User), Select User (John, Jacob, Jennifer).

For the Issue contact section:
A user should be able to select a role and assign that role to a user. Each user should have email and phone number implictly coupled. A user should also be able to remove the user from their role assignment, and add new ones.

Once done, a user should be able to save their work. Since no API is available, this information should exist only as long as the browser session exists. A user should also be able to log out and return to the login screen.

TASK:

You must create a React application following the above requirments and leave a seperate readme instruction outlining in detail how to run the application locally.

You should have been granted access to the Figma file where you can explore the raw designs. The link to that is here:

https://www.figma.com/design/b3ISWQTm6BCQAcyraJp4sj/Sunflow-Assignment?node-id=15-111&node-type=frame

CODE QUALITY MANAGEMENT:

Ensure the code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
Utilize meaningful variable and method names.
Apply appropriate error handling and validation.
Adhere to SOLID principles in your design.

==GOOD LUCK==
